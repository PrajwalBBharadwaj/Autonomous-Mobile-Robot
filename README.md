The objective was to perform autonomous navigation of a directed maze using a turtlebot.

It initially involved working with OpenCV libraries to detect objects, followed by implementing PID controller to track the object at a particular distance. Next, used odometry and the previously implemented PID control to take the bot from point A to point B. Once that was done, a state ,machine was  that could switch between obstacle avoidance and goto goal behaviorimplemented. The next step was to use Navstack to navigate the robot in a localized environment. Finally, built a Knn based ML model to detect directions signs. 
All the above tasks culminated in the final demonstrations where the turtlebot was able to navigate out of directed maze successfully.
